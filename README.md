# Salary-Dataset-Analysis
This project aims to analyze and predict employee salaries based on various features like education, years of experience, job title, and location. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, we build a model to predict salaries, which can be useful for businesses in determining compensation based on employee attributes.
